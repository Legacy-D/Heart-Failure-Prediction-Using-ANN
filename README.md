# Heart-Failure-Prediction-Using-ANN
## Highlights
1. We observed the data attributes with plots for selecting the mains factors that truly increased the
probability of Heart failure.
2. By visualizing 4 features which have more correlation with Death_event.
3. We used 8 different models to see the accuracy and confusion matrix.
4. According to accuracy we select catboost, xgboost and Decision Tree are more optimized models to
predict more effectively.

## Introduction
❏ Cardiovascular diseases kill approximately 17 million people globally every year, and they mainly
exhibit as myocardial infarctions and heart failures.
❏ Heart failure (HF) occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the needs of the body.
❏ Available electronic medical records of patients quantify symptoms, body features, and clinical
laboratory test values, which can be used to perform biostatistics analysis aimed at highlighting
patterns and correlations otherwise undetectable by medical doctors.
❏ Machine learning, in particular, can predict patients’ survival from their data and can individuate the
most important features among those included in their medical records.
